codeHive is a lightweight web Application Development Framework with expressive elegant syntax. codeHive gives you an MVC structure allowing you to concentrate on the fun stuff while building web applications.

codeHive is tiny in code and huge in thought. Being lightweight and simple is fundamental to codeHive.

## Core values
- `MVC` - The MVC pattern, or Model View Controller, is at the heart of codeHive applications. It ensures your application is modular, name-spaced and doesn't descend into a mess of view and model logic by having a consistent architecture. It's great for teams, and brings a well needed structure to PHP development.
- `Modular` - While MVC gives you the best way to contribute, Modular let you write the code once and seperate every assignment independently.
- `Simplicity` - codeHive is a minimum possible viable product. It doesn't dictate you it way of programming, you can chose how to play with code in many ways, even your way, It is a huge framework consisting of different kinds of widgets and modules. The goal is to get things out of your way, letting you go ahead and do what you do best, build awesome web applications.
- `Extensions` : every thing you need is one step away from your hands, just put the extension in the extension folder then import it in your code, and you can create your own extensions and module in a minutes
