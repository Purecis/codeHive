##Contributing to CodeHive


CodeHive is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form of Issues or Pull Requests on the CodeHive repository on GitHub.


Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error in CodeHive then please check a few things first:

- There is not already an open Issue
- The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for closed Issues)
- Is it something really obvious that you fix it yourself?

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request, which is done by “Forking” the main repository and committing to your own copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.

###Support
Note that GitHub is not for general support questions!

If you are having trouble using a feature of CodeHive, ask for help on the forum.

If you are wondering if you are using something correctly or if you have found a bug, ask on the forum first.

###Compatibility
CodeHive recommends PHP 5.4 or newer to be used, but it should be compatible with PHP 5.3 so all code supplied must stick to this requirement.

###Develop with US
Fork latest version of codeHive then edit `.gitignore` file by removing `!` from `index.php` and `.htaccess` lines then you can allways push and pull from origin without editing your path every time
